\section*{\normalsize{How to run the code}}
All the code for this exercise can be found in \texttt{assignment-2.R}. I have
made a single function for each problem. For example, to see the output of
problem 1 (d), execute the function \texttt{problem1d()}.  From the UNIX
command-line, you can run
\begin{verbatim}
Rscript -e 'pdf("problem1b.pdf");
            source("assignment-2.R");
            problem1b()' > problem1b.out
\end{verbatim}
to produce the textual output file \texttt{problem1b.out} and any plots in
\texttt{problem1b.pdf}. All plots and R output was generated automatically at
the same time as this document.
