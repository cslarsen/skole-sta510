\problem{1 (a)}
The probability of getting \textit{any specific} sequence is exactly the same,
because if we list all possible outcomes for $n$ flips, each sequence will
appear exactly once.

It is understood that each flip is stochastic, meaning there is no memory
involved. Thus, each flip is independent of any other flips. That the coin is
unbiased means that the probability for getting heads or tails is exactly
$0.5$, i.e.~the outcome is both binary and evenly distributed. In fact, this is
called a \textit{Bernoulli process}, and each flip is a \textit{Bernoulli
trial}.

In mathematical terms, we have that
\begin{align*}
  P(\textrm{HHTHT}) = P(\textrm{THHHT}) = P(\textrm{five flips}) =
    \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{32}
\end{align*}
Conversely, we see that there are $2^5 = 32$ possible ways to toss a fair coin
five times.

\problem{1 (b)}
I modified the lecture code to simulate the number of heads in five coin flips.
The relative frequencies for different number of simulations are shown in
figure \vref{plot.1b}.

As the number of simulations increase, we can see that the plot seem to
approximate the normal distribution. This is what we expect from a discrete,
Binomial distribution.

\end{figure}

\problem{1 (c)}
I added the keyword argument \texttt{prob=c(0.4, 0.6)} to the \texttt{sample}
function. That makes the probabilities for getting heads and tails 0.6 and 0.4,
correspondingly.

The resulting plots can be seen in figure \vref{plot.1c}. We clearly see that
for a large number of samples, the plots are skewed to the right, as we expect.

\problem{2 (a)}
The definition for a probability mass function (PMF) require that
\begin{gather}
  f(x) \geqslant 0 \label{pmf.1} \\
  \sum_x{f(x)} = 1 \label{pmf.2} \\
  f(x) = P(X=x) \label{pmf.3}
\end{gather}
For $f(x) = x/c$ with $x=1,2,3,4$, we see that (\ref{pmf.1}) is already met.
For (\ref{pmf.2}) and (\ref{pmf.3}), we must have $c=1+2+3+4=10$. A plot can be
seen in figure \vref{plot.2a}.

\end{figure}

\problem{2 (b)}
For $f(x) = c(x+1)^2$, $x=0,1,2,3$ we have the sum $c+4c+9c+16c=30c$. To make
$\sum{f}=1$ we must therefore have $c=\frac{1}{30}$. All other requirements are
then met. The plot can be found in figure \vref{plot.2b}.

\problem{3}
Since we have a finite number of values, the expected value $E(X)$ is given by
\[
  E[X] = x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + \cdots + x_kp_k
\]
where $x_n$ is the outcome of the random variable, while $p_n$ is its
probability. Since we already know $c$ in both cases, we can just plug the
numbers in.

\paragraph{The expected value for problem 2 (a)}
\[
  E(X) =
      1\frac{1}{c} +
      2\frac{2}{c} +
      3\frac{3}{c} +
      4\frac{4}{c} +
      = \frac{30}{c}
\]
With $c=10$ we then get $E(X) = 3$.

\paragraph{The expected value for problem 2 (b)}
\[
  E(X) =
    0 +
    1 c(1+1)^2 +
    2 c(2+1)^2 +
    3 c(3+1)^2 =
    4c + 18c + 48c = 70c
\]
With $c=\frac{1}{30}$ we get $E(x) = \frac{7}{3} \approx 2.33$.

\problem{5 (a)}
To determine $k$, we use the fact that any probability density function (PDF)
must have an area of exactly one (of course without any negative
probabilities). Since $f(x) = 0$ for $|x| > 1$, we only have to solve
\begin{align*}
  \int_{-1}^{1}{k(1-x^2)~dx} &= 1 \\
  k\left[ x - \frac{1}{3}{x^3} \right]_{-1}^{1} =
  k\left( 1 - \frac{1}{3} + 1 - \frac{1}{3} \right) = \frac{4}{3}k &= 1 \\
   k &= \frac{3}{4}
\end{align*}
